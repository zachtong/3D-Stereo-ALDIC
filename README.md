![Demo video](assets/images/stereo-ALDIC_demo.gif)
## Overview
3D-Stereo-ALDIC (3D Stereo Adaptive Mesh Augmented Lagrangian Digital Image Correlation) is a MATLAB-based implementation for full-field 3D deformation measurement using stereo vision and adaptive quadtree mesh refinement. This tool provides accurate and efficient 3D displacement, strain measurements for experimental mechanics applications.

## Features
- User-friendly tool for 3D deformation measurement.
- Fast and robust algorithm using distributed parallel computing
- Global kinematic compatibility enforced through augmented Lagrangian formulation
- Adaptive quadtree mesh refinement for optimal spatial resolution
- Support for both accumulative mode nd incremental DIC mode (for large deformation analysis)
- Multiple camera calibration format support (MATLAB, MatchID, MCC, DICe, OpenCorr)
- Comprehensive strain field computation
- Advanced visualization tools for results analysis

## Requirements
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox
- minGW 64 C++ compiler for MEX file compilation
